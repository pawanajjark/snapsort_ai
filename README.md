# SnapSort

SnapSort is a desktop app that turns messy screenshot folders into clean, searchable libraries in minutes. Drop a folder, review the preview, and accept a tidy structure you can trust.

## Story

My Mac desktop was drowning in screenshots, so I built SnapSort to organize them in minutes—clean names, smart categories, and full control before any files move.
